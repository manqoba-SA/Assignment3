# Educational Data Analysis of South Africa

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores a dataset of educational indicators for South Africa. The data includes a wide range of metrics that track various aspects of the education system over multiple years.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset, named `education_zaf.csv`, is a comprehensive collection of education-related indicators from South Africa. It covers a plethora of variables ranging from enrollment rates and average years of schooling to government expenditure on education and literacy rates.

## Analysis Summary

The Jupyter Notebook within this repository carries out the following analyses:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Inspection of data types and handling of missing values.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of central tendency, dispersion, and distribution metrics for different educational indicators.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Exploration of trends over time in educational attainment and government expenditure.
- **Visualizations**: Line graphs and bar charts to illustrate the findings and trends within the data.

## Key Insights

The analysis led to several key insights, including:
- A decline in the population with no education, especially among young females.
- Growth in higher educational attainment, with notable gender parity in recent years.
- Increased government investment in education, as reflected by the GDP percentage.
